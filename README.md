## Tech

LightFish does not need a lot to work!

- Language - Just PHP
- Live server - XAMPP, LAMPP, WAMPP. Really, anything will do!

And of course LightFish itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.

## Installation

Dillinger requires [a live server](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) to run.

Install the framework and start the server.

For production environments change the config...

```php
define('DATABASE_NAME', 'What ever you like!');
etc.
```

## Plugins

LightFish is very modular, you can use your own classes if you'd like.
Just drag them in the classes tab.

## Development

Want to contribute? Great! Leave a change request and we will take a look at it.
